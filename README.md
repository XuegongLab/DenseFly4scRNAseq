# DenseFly4scRNAseq

## Introduction

We explored mapping cells of different datasets using DenseFly algorithm as well as its relatives.

The results indicate DenseFly maps single-cell transcriptomics data well regardless of the data sparsity and batch effects, which is common in single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments.

## Requirement

Python >=3.6

R >=3.5.2

splatter =3.8

scater =1.12.2

## Usage

* To get the data set, you should run the R scripts under the folder 'data_generator'. Read the 'Additional_file_1-Details_of_simulation_datasets.pptx' for more infomation.

* You can find all the scripts under the folder 'scripts' and reproduce our experiments. The experiments are written in python. You need a Jupyter Notebook to read them.
